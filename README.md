### Hi, I’m Xavier 👋

Computer Science @ UNC Charlotte — diving deep into **operating systems** and **embedded systems**.

- Low-level: **C/C++**, **AArch64 asm**, pointers, memory layout, ELF, syscalls
- OS: scheduling, concurrency, virtual memory, processes/threads, **Linux kernel** basics
- Embedded: **Raspberry Pi**, AVR/Arduino, sensors, **LoRa/GPS**, RTOS exploration
- Tooling: **gdb**, strace, perf, valgrind, **CMake**, Make, **QEMU**, Buildroot/Yocto

**What I’m building**
- 🐕 SAR tracker: GPS + LoRa collar + Pi base station (low-power, robust telemetry)
- ⌚️ Watch → Pi: heart-rate pipeline (HealthKit → BLE/HTTP → custom service on Linux)
- ⚙️ OS learning: small allocators, schedulers, and drivers on ARM boards

**I like**: deterministic code, measurable performance, and writing docs that future-me can read.

_Actively looking for embedded/OS-adjacent internship opportunities for 2025._
